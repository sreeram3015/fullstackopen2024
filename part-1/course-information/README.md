# Half Stack Application Development

This project is a basic React application built using Vite. It is part of an exercise series to learn and practice React fundamentals.

## Project Structure

- **App.jsx**: The main component that imports and renders `Header`, `Content`, and `Total` components.
- **Header.jsx**: A component that displays the course name.
- **Content.jsx**: A component that renders the `Part` components for each course part.
- **Part.jsx**: A component that displays the name and number of exercises for a single part.
- **Total.jsx**: A component that calculates and displays the total number of exercises.

## Project Purpose

This project is a learning exercise aimed at understanding how to:

- Use Vite to initialize a React application.
- Create and use React components.
- Pass data between components using props.
- Refactor components for better modularity and separation of concerns by managing course data as a single object.
